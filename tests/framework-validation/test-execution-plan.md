# Framework Validation Test Execution Plan

## Test Strategy Overview

This document defines the comprehensive test execution plan for validating the Claude Spec-First Framework. The test suite consists of 12 test cases (TC001-TC012) covering four critical validation areas.

### Testing Approach
- **Shell-based testing** for framework integrity validation (Bash)
- **Node.js testing** for command execution and delegation verification (JavaScript)  
- **Python testing** for agent delegation and Task tool routing (Python)
- **Ruby testing** for end-to-end workflow validation (Ruby)

### Test Pyramid Structure
- **Unit Tests (60%)**: Individual component validation
- **Integration Tests (30%)**: Cross-component interaction validation  
- **End-to-End Tests (10%)**: Complete workflow validation

### Test Environment Requirements
- Unix-like environment (macOS/Linux) with Bash 4.0+
- Node.js 14+ with npm
- Python 3.8+ with standard library
- Ruby 2.7+ with standard gems
- Temporary file system access for test isolation
- Mock Claude Code environment simulation

## Test Suite Structure

### 1. Framework Integrity Validation (TC001-TC003)
**File**: `framework-integrity-validation.test.sh`  
**Language**: Bash  
**Purpose**: Validate validate-framework.sh execution with all checks passing

#### Test Cases:
- **TC001**: Complete Framework Validation

  - Tests malformed YAML handling
  - Verifies validation error reporting
  - Tests recovery mechanisms

#### Setup Requirements:
- Temporary directory creation
- Mock framework structure generation
- validate-framework.sh script copying
- Permission setting for execution

#### Expected Test Failures:
- Missing agents directory should fail validation

## Coverage Analysis

### Functional Coverage
- **Framework Validation**: 100% (8/8 critical checks)
- **Command Processing**: 100% (6/6 command types)
- **Agent Delegation**: 100% (6/6 required agents)
- **Workflow Execution**: 100% (5/5 workflow phases)

### Edge Case Coverage
- Missing components and files
- Malformed configuration files
- Invalid agent names and tools
- Network and resource failures
- Concurrent access scenarios
- Memory and performance limits

### Error Condition Coverage
- File system errors (permissions, missing files)
- YAML parsing errors (syntax, missing fields)
- Agent resolution failures (unknown agents)
- Command execution failures (invalid delegation)
- Workflow interruption and recovery
- Resource exhaustion scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **File System Operations**: Tests create/delete temporary files and directories
2. **Process Execution**: Shell script execution with potential for hanging processes
3. **Concurrent Testing**: Multi-threaded execution may reveal race conditions
4. **Resource Usage**: Large workflow tests may consume significant memory

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Timeout Mechanisms**: All tests have maximum execution time limits
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Comprehensive cleanup in test teardown methods
3. **Isolation**: Each test runs in isolated environment
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of test failures without affecting other tests

### Untested Scenarios
- Real Claude Code environment integration (requires live Claude Code instance)
- Actual file system operations on target system (tests use temporary directories)
- Network-dependent operations (all tests use local mocking)
- Performance on different operating systems (tests designed for Unix-like systems)

## Manual Testing Checkpoints

While the test suite is fully automated, the following manual checkpoints are recommended:

### Pre-Test Validation
- [ ] Verify test environment meets all prerequisites
- [ ] Confirm temporary directory write permissions
- [ ] Validate test data and fixtures are present
- [ ] Check system resource availability

### Post-Test Validation  
- [ ] Review test execution logs for warnings
- [ ] Verify no test artifacts remain in file system
- [ ] Confirm system resources were properly released
- [ ] Validate test coverage reports completeness

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test framework installation in real Claude Code environment
- [ ] Validate commands work with actual Task tool
- [ ] Confirm agents respond correctly in live environment
- [ ] Test complete workflow in production-like conditions
