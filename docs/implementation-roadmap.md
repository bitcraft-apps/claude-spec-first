2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining test passage

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 95% coverage for all custom logic
- **Integration Tests**: 100% coverage for GitHub API interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Load and response time validation
- **Security Tests**: Input validation and attack prevention

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before proceeding to next phase
- Code quality metrics must meet established thresholds
