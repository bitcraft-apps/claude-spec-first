# Specification-First Development Framework for Claude Code

A comprehensive framework for building high-quality software using specification-first development principles with Claude Code's native sub-agents and commands.

## üéØ Overview

This framework transforms Claude Code into a professional development environment that follows specification-first principles:

**Requirements ‚Üí Specifications ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Quality Assurance**

### Key Benefits

**Output:** Phase-by-phase implementation roadmap with timelines

#### Step 4: Implementation Execution
*Use impl-specialist directly for implementation:*

```
Use impl-specialist to implement the user profile API endpoint 
following the TDD approach with the specifications and tests created.
```

**What happens:**
- Code written to pass all predefined tests
- Architecture guidelines followed exactly

- Specifications before implementation
- Test-driven development approach
- Quality gates at each phase
- Requirements traceability maintenance

### Customization Options

#### Project-Specific Agents
Create project-specific agents in `.claude/agents/` to override global agents:
```
.claude/agents/project-specific-validator.md
```

#### Custom Commands
Add project-specific commands in `.claude/commands/`:
```
.claude/commands/deploy-check.md
```

#### Quality Standards
Customize quality standards in `CLAUDE.md` for your project:
```markdown
## Quality Standards
- Test coverage minimum: 95%
- Performance benchmarks: < 200ms API response
- Security scan: Zero critical vulnerabilities
```

## üìã Best Practices

### For Maximum Effectiveness

1. **Start with Clear Requirements**
   - Provide specific, measurable business requirements
   - Include constraints, assumptions, and success criteria
   - Be prepared to answer clarifying questions

2. **Follow the Process**
   - Don't skip phases - each builds on the previous one
   - Complete specification review before implementation
   - Use quality gates to prevent downstream issues

3. **Maintain Traceability**
   - Keep specifications updated as requirements change
   - Ensure tests always match current specifications
   - Document decisions and rationale

4. **Leverage Multi-Agent Validation**
   - Use `/spec-review` for critical features
   - Get cross-agent validation for complex architectures
   - Let `/qa-check` provide final deployment readiness

### Common Patterns

#### Simple Feature Development
```
/spec-init ‚Üí implement with impl-specialist ‚Üí /qa-check
```

#### Complex System Design
```
/spec-workflow ‚Üí extensive multi-agent collaboration
```

#### Legacy Code Enhancement
```
/spec-review existing-feature ‚Üí /impl-plan improvements ‚Üí implement ‚Üí /qa-check
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Working
- **Issue**: `/spec-init` not found
- **Solution**: Restart Claude Code to load new commands
- **Prevention**: Commands are cached and need restart to reload

### Agents Not Available
- **Issue**: spec-analyst not found when delegating
- **Solution**: Check `/agents` command to verify agents are loaded
- **Fix**: Restart Claude Code if agents aren't detected

### Poor Quality Outputs
- **Issue**: Specifications are too vague or incomplete
- **Solution**: Provide more detailed requirements and answer all clarifying questions
- **Best Practice**: Include examples, constraints, and success criteria

### Integration Issues
- **Issue**: Commands don't properly delegate to agents
- **Solution**: Use explicit agent invocation if automatic delegation fails
- **Workaround**: Manually invoke agents using the Task tool

## üìà Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure framework effectiveness:

- **Quality Metrics**: Defect reduction, test coverage, deployment success rate
- **Velocity Metrics**: Time from requirements to deployment, rework reduction
- **Process Metrics**: Specification completeness, requirement changes, quality gate pass rates
- **Team Metrics**: Developer satisfaction, onboarding time, process adoption

## ü§ù Contributing

### Framework Improvements
1. Test new agents and commands with real projects
2. Submit issues for bugs or improvement suggestions
3. Share successful workflow patterns and templates
4. Contribute example projects and use cases

### Quality Assurance
- All changes should pass through the framework's own QA process
- Test new features with multiple project types
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
