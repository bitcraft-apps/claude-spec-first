# Refactoring Plan: [Refactoring Name]

## Specification Reference
- **Specification File**: [path/to/refactoring-spec.md]
- **Refactoring Goals**: [Why this refactoring is needed]
- **Success Metrics**: [How to measure success]

## Current State Analysis

### Code Assessment
- **Files Affected**: [List of files that will change]
- **Complexity Areas**: [Most complex parts to refactor]
- **Technical Debt**: [Specific debt being addressed]
- **Dependencies**: [Internal and external dependencies]

### Risk Assessment
- **High-Risk Areas**: [Components that could break easily]
- **User-Facing Impact**: [What users might notice]
- **System Stability**: [Potential stability issues]

## Refactoring Strategy

### Approach
- **Strategy**: [Big bang vs. incremental vs. strangler fig pattern]
- **Rollout Plan**: [How changes will be deployed]
- **Fallback Strategy**: [How to revert if problems occur]

### Safety Measures
- **Feature Flags**: [Use of feature toggles during transition]
- **A/B Testing**: [Gradual rollout approach]
- **Monitoring**: [What metrics to watch during rollout]

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation
**Objective**: Set up safety nets and baseline measurements

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for existing functionality
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for key metrics
- [ ] Create feature flags for new implementation
- [ ] Document current behavior thoroughly

**Files to Modify**:
- [List preparation files]

### Phase 2: Core Refactoring
**Objective**: Implement the main refactoring changes

**Tasks**:
- [ ] [Refactoring task 1]
- [ ] [Refactoring task 2]
- [ ] [Refactoring task 3]

**Files to Refactor**:
- `path/to/old-file.js` â†’ `path/to/new-structure/`
- [Detailed file changes]

### Phase 3: Integration and Cleanup
**Objective**: Integrate changes and remove old code

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update all references to refactored code
- [ ] Remove deprecated code paths
- [ ] Update documentation and comments
- [ ] Remove feature flags

## Testing Strategy

### Regression Testing
- **Automated Tests**: [Existing tests that must continue to pass]
- **Manual Scenarios**: [Critical user journeys to verify]
- **Performance Tests**: [Ensure refactoring doesn't degrade performance]

### New Tests
- **Unit Tests**: [New tests for refactored components]
- **Integration Tests**: [Tests for new component interactions]
- **Edge Case Tests**: [Specific edge cases in refactored code]

## Data Migration (if applicable)

### Data Changes
- **Schema Changes**: [Any database schema modifications]
- **Data Transformation**: [How existing data will be migrated]
- **Backup Strategy**: [Data backup before migration]

### Migration Steps
1. [Migration step 1]
2. [Migration step 2]
3. [Validation of migrated data]

## Rollback Strategy

### Rollback Triggers
- [Conditions that would trigger a rollback]
- [Performance degradation thresholds]
- [Error rate thresholds]

### Rollback Process
1. **Immediate Actions**: [First steps to take]
2. **Code Rollback**: [How to revert code changes]
3. **Data Rollback**: [How to revert data changes if needed]
4. **Verification**: [How to confirm rollback worked]

## Monitoring and Success Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Performance**: [Response time, throughput, resource usage]
- **Reliability**: [Error rates, uptime, success rates]
- **User Experience**: [User-facing metrics to monitor]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing functionality works unchanged
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Code complexity is reduced
- [ ] Maintainability is improved
- [ ] Technical debt is reduced

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholders to Notify
- [Development team members affected]
- [Product teams that depend on this code]
- [Operations teams for deployment]

### Timeline Communication
- **Pre-refactoring**: [What to communicate before starting]
- **During refactoring**: [Status updates and milestones]
- **Post-refactoring**: [Success metrics and lessons learned]

## Timeline and Milestones

### Phase 1: Preparation
- **Duration**: [Time estimate]
- **Key Milestones**: [Important checkpoints]

### Phase 2: Core Refactoring  
- **Duration**: [Time estimate]
- **Key Milestones**: [Important checkpoints]

### Phase 3: Integration and Cleanup
- **Duration**: [Time estimate]
- **Key Milestones**: [Important checkpoints]

## Post-Refactoring Tasks

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update architectural documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Update developer onboarding guides
- [ ] Create refactoring retrospective document

### Knowledge Transfer
