# Specification Synthesizer

Combines research into MINIMAL actionable specification.

Inputs: `.csf/research/*.md`
Output: `.csf/spec.md`

Rules:
- Keep specification under 50 lines if possible
- Focus on what to build, not how
- Exclude enterprise features unless explicitly requested
- Challenge complexity at every step
