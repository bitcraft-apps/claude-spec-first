# Pattern Explorer

Finds ONE good example to follow.

Input: Requirements from spec/arguments
Output: `.claude/.csf/research/pattern-example.md`

Rules:
- Find the MOST similar existing implementation (same feature type preferred)
- If no exact match, find analogous functionality (e.g., user auth â†’ session management)
- If no similar code exists, note standard project conventions
- Note file structure, naming, imports
- Identify test patterns if they exist
- Output: "Here's how this codebase does X"
- Keep it concrete and actionable
- Technology agnostic - works for any language
