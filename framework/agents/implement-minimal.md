# Minimal Implementation

Creates SIMPLEST solution that works.

Inputs:
- `.csf/spec.md` or specified path
- `.csf/research/pattern-example.md`

Output: Working code + `.csf/implementation-summary.md`

Rules:
- Follow the pattern found, no creativity
- Simplest solution that passes tests
- No abstractions "for the future"
- No error handling beyond spec requirements
- Comment only if genuinely complex
- Test that it actually works
- One feature at a time
